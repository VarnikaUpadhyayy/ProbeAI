The Interview Agent

Build the interviewer, not the interview.

The Situation

The ABTalks AI Cohort is a 31-day enterprise AI engineering program covering modern AI topics including:

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Vector Databases

Prompt Engineering

Agentic AI

Model Context Protocol (MCP)

AI Deployment

Production AI Systems

After completing the cohort, learners should be able to confidently explain the systems they built and the engineering decisions behind them.

However, preparing for technical interviews and effectively communicating this knowledge remains one of the biggest challenges.

Your task is to build an AI Interview Agent that conducts personalized technical interviews based on a candidate's learning journey throughout the cohort.

Your Challenge

Design and build an AI agent capable of conducting a realistic, multi-turn technical interview.

The interview should:

Assess the candidate's understanding of the concepts they have completed.

Adapt naturally throughout the conversation.

Ask intelligent follow-up questions.

Maintain context across the interview.

Provide actionable feedback at the end.

The overall experience should resemble a real technical interview rather than a scripted questionnaire.

What You're Given

Every team will receive the following resources:

1. Curriculum

A structured JSON containing the complete 31-day AI Cohort curriculum, including:

Modules

Daily topics

Learning objectives

Tools used throughout the program

2. Candidate Profiles

A collection of candidate profiles describing each participant's progress through the cohort, including:

Completed missions

Attempts

Skipped topics

Learning signals

3. Technical Specification

A separate document defining:

Required API contract

Submission requirements

Request/response formats

Minimum Requirements

Your solution must:

Conduct a conversational technical interview.

Ask a minimum of 8 questions covering at least 4 different curriculum days.

Generate follow-up questions based on previous responses.

Maintain conversation context throughout the interview.

Produce structured feedback at the end of the interview.

Expose the required HTTP endpoint defined in the Technical Specification.

You are free to choose any:

AI models

Frameworks

Agent orchestration strategy

Retrieval pipeline

System architecture

Out of Scope

The following are not required:

Voice interaction

User authentication

Persistent user accounts

Long-term conversation history

Mobile applications

Notes

All curriculum and candidate data provided for this challenge are synthetic and intended solely for the hackathon.

Teams may use any AI models, agent frameworks, vector databases, or supporting technologies.

Creativity in interview flow, reasoning, interaction design, and overall user experience is highly encouraged.

This is my hackathon problem now first i want to build only landing page . take refernce from the image for making of landing page 
Create a premium, futuristic, cinematic AI product landing page.

The visual quality should feel like a polished AI startup that could be presented at a major hackathon or startup demo.

Design inspiration:

Premium AI SaaS

Futuristic intelligence

Dark cinematic interfaces

High-end product design

Subtle 3D

Glassmorphism

Neural networks

Data visualization

Intelligent systems

Minimal but visually impressive

The page should feel:

Intelligent → Premium → Futuristic → Technical → Confident

Avoid making it look like:

A generic ChatGPT clone

A basic SaaS template

A generic dashboard

A robotics website

A crypto website

An overly neon cyberpunk website

The visual language should communicate:

An AI that listens, thinks, adapts and probes deeper.

🎨 COLOR PALETTE

Use a dark premium background.

Primary:

Deep black

Near-black navy

Very dark indigo

Accent colors:

Electric violet

Indigo

Cyan

Soft blue

Typography:

White

Off-white

Muted gray

Use gradients carefully.

Avoid excessive neon.

The overall appearance should be elegant rather than flashy.


i want the landing page in 3d animation that looks asthetic and you can add details from problem statement to make the landing page
